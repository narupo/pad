Cap
===

 Welcome to Cap's documentation.


What is Cap ?
=============

 Cap is file manager for programmer's snippet codes.
 Cap is quick and clean on your file system.


Build
=====

How to build of Cap.


UNIX
----

    $ git clone https://github.com/narupo/cap
    $ cd cap
    $ make init && make
    $ ./build/cap -h


Windows
-------

 Using MinGW's make.

    $ git clone https://github.com/narupo/cap
    $ cd cap
    $ mingw32-make init && mingw32-make
    $ ./build/cap -h    


Example
=======

 Set your home directory. That is origin of position of environment.

    $ cap home /my/snippet/file/directory
    $ cap home

 Check current environment.

    $ cap pwd

 Check current environment files.

    $ cap ls
 
 Get file content.

    $ cap cat myfile.txt

 Change environment.

    $ cap cd next/env

 Run script.

    $ cap run bin/hello_world.py

 Set editor.

    $ cap editor /usr/bin/vim

 Edit file by editor.

    $ cap edit /path/to/file.txt

 Edit resource file in current environment.

    $ cap edit .caprc


Resource file
=============

 Cap is supporting resource file with Cap's template language.
 You should be create '.caprc' at home directory (of course, that is Cap's
home) or current directory, and write the following.

    {@
        import alias
        alias.set("hw", "run bin/hello_world.py")
        alias.set("banana", "cat banana.txt")
    @}

 And execute the following.

    $ cap hw
    $ cap banana

 This is function of alias of Cap.


Cap + Plugin of editor
======================

 Of course, Cap is needing plugin for the editor. And you will call Cap from
the editor. Like a `cap-subl3` plugin (https://github.com/narupo/cap-subl3).

    Snippet codes --+-- Windows --+-- Cap --+-- Plugin + Editor
                    |             |         |
                    +--- UNIX ----+         +-- Plugin + Editor
                                  |         |
                                 ...       ... 

 Cap's resource detaching from the editor. Your snippet codes be separated from
the editor.
 So, your snippet codes become long life on the file system years and years.
